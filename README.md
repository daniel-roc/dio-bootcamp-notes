## About the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of the notes and key takeaways from each course I take on the DIO.me platform. This will help me organize and review the information I learn from each course in the future.

<br>

## Usage

Feel free to browse the notes I have taken from each course. You can find them in the corresponding folder for each course. If you are taking the same course, you may find my notes useful as a reference or review material.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal repository, I will not be accepting any contributions. However, if you find any mistakes or errors in my notes, please feel free to contact me and let me know.
